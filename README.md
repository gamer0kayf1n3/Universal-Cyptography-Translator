It's not yet done though, but here are some things that I already added, and plannning to get added.

- [x] Rot13 (Rotate 13) Encode
- [x] Caesar Cipher Encode
- [x] Affine Cipher Encode
- [x] Vigenere Cipher Encode
- [x] Binary Encode
- [ ] Base32 Encode

- [ ] Base64 Decode
- [ ] Rot13 Decode
- [ ] Caesar Cipher Decode
